# ChombyBot
A virtual pet for your Discord server..

"Are you looking for a friend? Someone to walk on the beaches of Azeroth with? Me too! How about a cuddle on the couch and someone who will listen and not judge you while you cut 1,000 yew logs? So am I! I’m not looking for just anyone. Someone who will appreciate my protective nature (no door bells needed!)! I’m not only a little cutie with my gnarled teeth and big brown eyes, I have substance and intelligence! I have learned the basics like getting the door, fetch, can drink water, and would love to continue learning new things." - Chomby
